						<h2>6 Essential Management Fundamentals</h2>
					</header>

					<h3>My friend's story - a common management problem</h3>

					<p>A couple of weeks ago, I had lunch with a friend who runs his own business. As 
					the company has become more successful, he’s had to delegate more and more 
					responsibility and has recently promoted two people into management positions 
					- one with a little previous experience and one completely new to management.
					They are both very talented at their specialist jobs but are struggling with areas 
					of the management role - a situation I come across regularly with clients. My 
					friend was finding it difficult to help them and asked if I could advise them on a 
					few management fundamentals.</p>

					<h3>What does the research say?</h3>

					<p>So, what are the characteristics and behaviours demonstrated by good 
					managers? What does a modern manager need to be able to do now, and what 
					skills are they likely to need in the future?</p>

					<p>Last year, the Commission on the Future of Management and Leadership and the 
					Chartered Management Institute published a report on exactly this topic – 
					Management 2020, Leadership to Unlock Long Term Growth. It’s well worth a 
					read. <a href="http://www.managers.org.uk/~/media/Files/PDF/M2020/Management%202020%20-%20Leadership%20to%20unlock%20long-term%20growth.pdf">Read Management 2020, Leadership to Unlock Long Term Growth</a>.</p>

					<p>The report looked at how well managers in the UK are performing alongside the 
					skills and behaviours they need for their businesses to thrive. At Reed Learning 
					we’ve also done our own research into management best practice and designed 
					our courses around our findings.</p>

					<p>Below is a summary of the advice I gave to my friend's managers. I thought it 
					might be useful to share this with you ahead of our workshop to give you some 
					food for thought. </p>

					<h3>The 6 Fundamentals</h3>

					<p>Think of the below as the foundations of great management. This is by no means 
					an exhaustive list but if you can do all these things and do them well, you're on 
					your way to becoming a great manager.</p>

					<h4>Set a clear focus and communicate it</h4>

					<p>You make sure that people know what their job involves. You set clear, 
					measurable objectives and make sure they are aligned to those of the business; 
					everything your team does should go some way to achieving the vision and 
					strategic goals of your organisation. You set timescales and boundaries. You 
					monitor progress against objectives on an ongoing basis – not just at appraisal 
					time! </p>

					<h4>Coach your team members</h4>

					<p>You give feedback in the moment, as and when required. You let people know the 
					specifics of what they’re doing well and where they need to improve. You’re 
					constantly on the lookout for opportunities to discuss performance and 
					development. You adapt a coaching style where you enable people to get the best 
					from themselves, by asking thoughtful, probing questions and encouraging 
					reflection and commitment.</p>

					<h4>Adopt a flexible management style</h4>

					<p>You’re highly attuned to the fact that people in your team have different 
					personalities and approaches. You flex your style of management to suit the 
					individual as well as the situation to get the best out of them. </p>

					<h4>Relate, collaborate and innovate</h4>

					<p>You listen. You observe. You know that individuals are motivated by different 
					things and adapt your strategy accordingly. You demonstrate that you respect 
					difference. You allow people to have different perspectives and encourage open 
					discussion and collaboration inside and outside of your team to build trust and 
					generate new ways of doing things.</p>

					<h4>Drive, influence and inspire</h4>

					<p>You lead by example. You move others to action through the power of your 
					words and deeds. It’s no longer a case of people doing things for you simply 
					because you’re the boss. As business becomes less hierarchical, your ability to 
					inspire discretionary effort (people doing things because they want to) will 
					become increasingly important.</p>

					<h4>Empower and develop</h4>

					<p>You look for opportunities for people to express and develop their talent. You 
					delegate responsibility (but not accountability!) appropriately.  You encourage 
					people to constantly evaluate themselves, ask for feedback and look for 
					opportunities to learn.</p>
